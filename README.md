## Overview
ThreeDModuleMap is a React component that integrates Mapbox GL and Threebox to create a 3D visualization of earthquake data on a map. The project uses GeoJSON data to plot the locations, magnitudes, and depths of earthquakes, rendering them as 3D spheres with tooltips that provide additional information.

## Features
- 3D visualization of earthquake data using spheres.
- Color-coded spheres based on earthquake magnitude.
- Tooltips for each earthquake, displaying relevant information.
- Interactive map with terrain and hillshade layers for enhanced visualization.
